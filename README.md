Glitter is an app for your computer that allows you to add widgets to your screen. Now, there are many apps that do this. Where Glitter is different is that it allows those widgets to be written with web technologies, which drastically lowers the barrier to entry into the desktop customization "land".

You can download widgets made by other people, and you can also create your own. Glitter makes both easy - it's up to you.

#### Sample usecases:

* 🎥 **Video backgrounds** - Instead of a static, boring image, you can have a video playing as your wallpaper
* 🔔 **Get notifications** - Made another sale through Stripe? Got another YouTube subscriber? - Get a custom alert
* 🌡️ **Weather overview** - Do you need an umbrella, or a sun cream? Easily find out right from your desktop
* 📈 **PC performance** - Track your CPU / RAM / HDD usage through nice looking charts instead of digging through outdated interfaces
* ⏩ **Video/audio players** - Create a custom interface for your favourite player - Spotify, YouTube, etc.
